# Ordinal
An implementation of ordinal numbers and their operations and properties in the Coq proof
assistant.

Note that a similar-in-spirit implementation,
[minkiminki/Ordinal](https://github.com/minkiminki/Ordinal), already exists and is
rather more complete (and better-documented) than this one. I was not aware of it when I
began working on this, but since this is mostly an exercise for my own edification I
probably would have done so anyway. If you are looking for something you can use now
you are probably better off with that one, as this is a work-in-progress and will
probably have many breaking changes.
